Trying out git with the command line

1. I just initilised this folder with the command git init. 
2. Next I'll add it to my stgging area using the command 'git add'.
3. Then I'll check its status in the stagging area using the command 'git status'.
4. Finally commiting the file to my git repository with the command 'git commit -m "filname" '. 
The -m flag is used to write the commit message.
5. Use 'git log' to check the commits already made.
6. Use 'git add *' to add all files to the stagging area
7. use 'git diff filename' to check the difference between the present file and the previous commited file.
Use 'git diff .' to check the above for each file in a stagging area
8. Use 'git checkout filename' inorder to revert a file to its previous version. Extra 'git checkout .'
