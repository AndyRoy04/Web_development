My command line skills continue from here

What i learnt
1. Directory navigation (ls, cd, etc)
2. Using touch, start, open, rmdir, mkdir

    mkdir directoryName : creates a new directory
    rmdir directoryName: removes an empty directory
    rmdir -r directoryName: removes a directory

    touch filename : Creates a file
    start filename : opens on windows
    open filename : opens the file on linuxOS and macOS

    open -a ''app apth'' : entering the app path opens the file on that application
    code filename : opens the file on VScode 


Good bye...
